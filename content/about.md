Where to begin? I started my foray into technology in highschool writing a blog. A blog with no real aim - rather a place for me to write about tech things I enjoyed. Like any blog owner you want it to be read. That want lead me to to search engine optimization (SEO) which quickly became a passion. For me it wasn't about gaming the algorithm, it was about understanding there was a balance between finding what a user wanted and what Google wanted.
While in my senior year of highschool I found part time work freelancing as an SEO specialist. Upon leaving highschool I dove into the work force finding roles in agencies as an SEO / SEM campaign manager. 3 years after working in a couple agencies I branched out and started my own consultancy. It was a hell of a ride. 7 years later I learned a lot about myself, the industry and, the headache that is running your own business.

The past few years my interest in coding and infosec has grown exponentially. To a point where I find myself freelancing my marketing skillset to pay the bills while spending more and more time delving into topics I have a passion for (python and pentesting). I've decided that by starting a blog and to document my progression may be the jolt I need like before to dive into either coding or infosec as a profession. 

Realistically I don't see that happening any time soon, but why not write about what brings me joy. I'm learning a lot, having a blast and, along the way if I can help one individual banging their head on their keyboard in frustation coding or trying to root a HTB lab this will all be worth it.

Soon enough I'll link to my HTB and TryHackMe if you'd like to join me in some extremly noob exploits.
