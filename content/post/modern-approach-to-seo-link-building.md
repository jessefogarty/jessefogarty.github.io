# A Modern Approach to Link Building for SEO

> *Skip to the bottom of the article for a real life example of a modern approach to link building. Read through for a history of link building and how / why things changed.*

Links, links and more links -the more the merrier. This has been a prevailing and befuddling myth that has sustained itself within the SEO community. It's been about 5 -10 years since an SEO could acquire inbound links with select anchor text that would boost their SERP rankings for almost any given phrase.

However we must remember this was at a time when machine learning was in it's relative infancy and I'd argue Google's algorithm. It's honestly hard to argue otherwise - it was a good time but it wasn't going to be for a long time. 

It was a time when SEO's could focus techniques to game the algorithm such as:
- creating a new page for each search term
	- ensuring the page's h1 tag had the term
	- that the keyword density was within a %
	- that the length of the articles content was within a word count
- guest blogging as a form of linking building and sites were created just to provide a home for poorly written articles with X number of outbound links.
	- some were even deemed ethical if they required nofollow tags.

It was the wild west. But, it was also a time when Google didn't have much competition - Bing wasn't Bing and, Yahoo had fallen off. Google enjoyed - and still does - a monopoly on search that could withstand irrelevant SERP and thus a relatively poor UX.

### So what changed?

While no ones really knows not even Google employees who work on the search algorithm. However I would argue it really boils down to the adoption of machine learning, more specifically natural language processing (NLP).

With the use of NLP Google can better understand, categorize and, rate the relevancy of a web page without humans having to create manual rules. While that's not an absolute truth because no one really knows I'll explain why I believe this to be the case.

Manual rules such as weighing h1 text, links etc. lead to many years when through tests SEO's could figure out what weighed more and focus on optimizing for it - think of the aforementioned keyword density, word count, # of links.

Links were the last manual rule that carried weight. Link building was a pyramid that passed down "authority" from a top level link .gov .edu. The closer you got to obtaining a link with anchor text and with a follow tag the better your chances of a ranking boost. This was seen as vouching for the relevancy of the page it was linking to.

In later years, when Google started revising to account for guest blogging farms it inadvertently increased the weight of "higher quality" links. This is when boutique link building agencies popped up like weeds.

### Do we just give up on link building?

**In short no**. But you can and should not think of link building as a technique in itself. Realistically you shouldn't be focusing on any one thing alone for SEO. SEO should be part of your websites over all digital marketing plan and will accordingly build links as your marketing campaign progresses.

## An example from my past work

The client was a B2C printing company they wanted to improve their online reputation. I had to acquire reviews and figured this would be a great way to also build links. 

I created profiles on multiple reviews websites that consumers often go to when on their buying journey i.e. TrustPilot. I knew that the company's page on the site would be a link but, I also knew that the review websites tended to rank high and CTR / retention was high (people reading reviews).

But this alone wouldn't be enough we still needed the consumers to actually write the reviews. So I spent a couple months compiling a list of past consumers with blogs and(or) who were active on social media. 

Those who were past customers I offered discounts and followed up to inquire about their purchase and see if they were help us by leaving a review. Those who were knew I placed an emphasis on people with a blog or, a social presence where they could write a review in addition to on a review site.

This proved to be and continues to be an immense benefit. I believe it's due to not so much the links but the content that links back. Going back to NLP, part of it often includes a sentiment analysis. So not only would Google be seeing links coming back but, they would be seeing a positive sentiment on the pages that pointed back. Was this a quick or easy method to improve rankings; no. But it's results are long lasting not only for SERP rankings but the company's overall online reputation management.

SEO is no longer about gaming the algorithm, or technical prowess. It's one part of the overall digital marketing landscape and should never be a company's main let alone sole consideration.
