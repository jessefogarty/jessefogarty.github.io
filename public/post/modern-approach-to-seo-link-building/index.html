<blockquote>
<p><em>Skip to the bottom of the article for a real life example of a modern approach to link building. Read through for a history of link building and how / why things changed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Links, links and more links -the more the merrier. This has been a prevailing and befuddling myth that has sustained itself within the SEO community. It&rsquo;s been about 5 -10 years since an SEO could acquire inbound links with select anchor text that would boost their SERP rankings for almost any given phrase.</p>
<p>However we must remember this was at a time when machine learning was in it&rsquo;s relative infancy and I&rsquo;d argue Google&rsquo;s algorithm. It&rsquo;s honestly hard to argue otherwise - it was a good time but it wasn&rsquo;t going to be for a long time.</p>
<p>It was a time when SEO&rsquo;s could focus techniques to game the algorithm such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating a new page for each search term
<ul>
<li>ensuring the page&rsquo;s h1 tag had the term</li>
<li>that the keyword density was within a %</li>
<li>that the length of the articles content was within a word count</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>guest blogging as a form of linking building and sites were created just to provide a home for poorly written articles with X number of outbound links.
<ul>
<li>some were even deemed ethical if they required nofollow tags.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It was the wild west. But, it was also a time when Google didn&rsquo;t have much competition - Bing wasn&rsquo;t Bing and, Yahoo had fallen off. Google enjoyed - and still does - a monopoly on search that could withstand irrelevant SERP and thus a relatively poor UX.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-changed">So what changed?</h3>
<p>While no ones really knows not even Google employees who work on the search algorithm. However I would argue it really boils down to the adoption of machine learning, more specifically natural language processing (NLP).</p>
<p>With the use of NLP Google can better understand, categorize and, rate the relevancy of a web page without humans having to create manual rules. While that&rsquo;s not an absolute truth because no one really knows I&rsquo;ll explain why I believe this to be the case.</p>
<p>Manual rules such as weighing h1 text, links etc. lead to many years when through tests SEO&rsquo;s could figure out what weighed more and focus on optimizing for it - think of the aforementioned keyword density, word count, # of links.</p>
<p>Links were the last manual rule that carried weight. Link building was a pyramid that passed down &ldquo;authority&rdquo; from a top level link .gov .edu. The closer you got to obtaining a link with anchor text and with a follow tag the better your chances of a ranking boost. This was seen as vouching for the relevancy of the page it was linking to.</p>
<p>In later years, when Google started revising to account for guest blogging farms it inadvertently increased the weight of &ldquo;higher quality&rdquo; links. This is when boutique link building agencies popped up like weeds.</p>
<h3 id="do-we-just-give-up-on-link-building">Do we just give up on link building?</h3>
<p><strong>In short no</strong>. But you can and should not think of link building as a technique in itself. Realistically you shouldn&rsquo;t be focusing on any one thing alone for SEO. SEO should be part of your websites over all digital marketing plan and will accordingly build links as your marketing campaign progresses.</p>
<h2 id="an-example-from-my-past-work">An example from my past work</h2>
<p>The client was a B2C printing company they wanted to improve their online reputation. I had to acquire reviews and figured this would be a great way to also build links.</p>
<p>I created profiles on multiple reviews websites that consumers often go to when on their buying journey i.e. TrustPilot. I knew that the company&rsquo;s page on the site would be a link but, I also knew that the review websites tended to rank high and CTR / retention was high (people reading reviews).</p>
<p>But this alone wouldn&rsquo;t be enough we still needed the consumers to actually write the reviews. So I spent a couple months compiling a list of past consumers with blogs and(or) who were active on social media.</p>
<p>Those who were past customers I offered discounts and followed up to inquire about their purchase and see if they were help us by leaving a review. Those who were knew I placed an emphasis on people with a blog or, a social presence where they could write a review in addition to on a review site.</p>
<p>This proved to be and continues to be an immense benefit. I believe it&rsquo;s due to not so much the links but the content that links back. Going back to NLP, part of it often includes a sentiment analysis. So not only would Google be seeing links coming back but, they would be seeing a positive sentiment on the pages that pointed back. Was this a quick or easy method to improve rankings; no. But it&rsquo;s results are long lasting not only for SERP rankings but the company&rsquo;s overall online reputation management.</p>
<p>SEO is no longer about gaming the algorithm, or technical prowess. It&rsquo;s one part of the overall digital marketing landscape and should never be a company&rsquo;s main let alone sole consideration.</p>
